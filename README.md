# ViewScript

A dyanmically typed language that transpiles to JavaScript. The goal of this language is to provide
JavaScript with a cleaner and more expressive syntax, and add some other new features to make development easy and quick,
such as better support for for-in loops, array comprehensions (hopefully), code-blocks-as-expressions (think Rust), and more.
